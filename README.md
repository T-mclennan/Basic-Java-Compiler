# Software Engineering Class Project (Java)

The core code was provided for the lexer, parser, constrainer, codegen, compiler.
Assignments for the class were to extend and modify this code using OO principles and design patterns. 

The interpreter, virtual machine, and bytecode language were implemented myself. 

The debugger portion is an extra credit assignment, and I look to finish it in the future.
